1. Write an algorithm to find the area of the triangle 

STEP 1. START
STEP 2. READ INPUT b, h
STEP 3. CALCULATE AREA (b * h) / 2
STEP 4. PRINT AREA
STEP 5. End

3.Write a pseudo code to perform the basic arithmetic operations. 

STEP 1. START
STEP 2. READ INPUTS a, b
STEP 3. PERFORM ADDITION OPERATION on a , b (a + b)
STEP 4. PERFORM SUBTRACTION OPERATION  on a , b (a - b)
STEP 5. PERFORM MULTIPLICATION OPERATION  on a , b (a * b)
STEP 6. PERFORM DIVISION OPERATION  on a , b (a / b)
STEP 7. PERFORM MODULUS OPERATION  on a , b (a % b)

6.Write an algorithm to calculate the simple interest using the formula.

Step 1 : START 
Step 2 : Declare variables  p , n , r  and  si
Step 3 : Read the values of variable  p ( principal ) , n ( Number of years ) , r ( Rate of Interest )
Step 4 : calculate the values of   si = ( p * n * r )/100 
Step 5 : Display si ( simple interest )
Step 6 : STOP 

7.Write an algorithm to find the largest of three numbers X, Y,Z


Step 1. START
Step 2. Read the three numbers to be compared, as A, B and C.
Step 3. Check if A is greater than B.
  3.1 If true, then check if A is greater than C.
    3.1.1 If true, print 'A' as the greatest number.
    3.1.2 If false, print 'C' as the greatest number.
  3.2 If false, then check if B is greater than C.
    3.1.1 If true, print 'B' as the greatest number.
    3.1.2 If false, print 'C' as the greatest number.
Step 4. STOP

8.Write an algorithm which will test whether a given integer value is prime or not.

Step 1: START
Step 2: Read number n
Step 3: Set f=0 Step 4: For i=2 to n-1
Step 5: If n mod 1=0 then
Step 6: Set f=1 and break
Step 7: Loop
Step 8: If f=0 then
print 'The given number is prime'
		else
print 'The given number is not prime'
Step 9: STOP
